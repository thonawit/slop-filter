// parallel against the same state, so adding one costs its own tokens and almost no
// latency — but batching several POSTS into one state is a different operation that
// degrades answers, and is not done here.

 * The state every question in the request shares.

 * The user's interests and excluded topics are deliberately NOT here. Each topic question
 * already carries its own `topic` inside its `instructions`, so a copy in the state was
 * redundant — and measurably harmful. Adding three interests and one excluded topic moved
 * the holistic verdict by up to +0.30 on borderline posts, always toward slop:
 *
 *   iro_selfdeprecating  0.42 -> 0.72
 *   iro_humbled_joke     0.43 -> 0.55
 *   edge_quoted_slop     0.24 -> 0.37
 *   sin_platitude        1.00 -> 1.00   (unambiguous slop is unaffected)
 *
 * This is the documented "large state full of irrelevant detail" failure mode: unrelated
 * material in the state costs accuracy on every question that does not use it. Anything
 * added here is paid for by all of them.
